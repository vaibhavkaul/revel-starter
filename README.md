# Welcome to Revel Starter

## Getting Started

This strips out all the View/Index stuff from the revel starter. This can serve as a starter for a simple REST app

### Start the web server:

    get revel: go get github.com/revel/revel
    get revel command line: go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
    
    Make sure $GOPATH is set and $GOPATH/bin is on the PATH

    revel run revel-starter

### Go to http://localhost:9000/orders and you'll see:

```json
[
    {
        "ID": 1,
        "Event": "Event 1",
        "UserId": 1
    },
    {
        "ID": 2,
        "Event": "Event 2",
        "UserId": 2
    },
    {
        "ID": 3,
        "Event": "Event 3",
        "UserId": 3
    }
]
```
